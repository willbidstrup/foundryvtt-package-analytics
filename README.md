# Foundry Virtual Tabletop Package Development Analytics

## What

This is a project for creating analytics around package development for Foundry VTT - a highly customisable virtual tabletop system, built primarily for use with tabletop roleplaying games.    
The content should be of interest to the Foundry VTT community, especially visitors to Foundry Hub and members of the League Of Extraordinary Foundry Developers.   
Please contact me if you would like to contribute.  


## Why

My motivations are:  

- Fun and community  
- Learn interesting things about what is being developed    
- Build and extend skills in data engineering, analytics, science and visualisation
