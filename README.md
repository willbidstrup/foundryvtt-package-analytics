# Foundry Virtual Tabletop Package Development Analytics

## What

This is a project for creating analytics around package development for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) - a highly customisable virtual tabletop system, built primarily for use with tabletop roleplaying games.    
The content should be of interest to the Foundry VTT community, especially visitors to the [Foundry Hub](https://www.foundryvtt-hub.com/) and members of the [League Of Extraordinary Foundry Developers](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers).   
Please contact me if you would like to contribute.  


## Why

This is a personal project with no official affiliation with Foundry VTT.    
My motivations are:  

- Have fun and build community  
- Learn interesting things about the Foundry VTT package development universe     
- Try new things in data engineering, analytics, science and visualisation
